This case study focuses on analyzing the quality control process at **DataStor**, a company that manufactures hard drives. The goal is to identify potential quality issues in the production process using statistical methods. The company uses a **PDQ test score** to assess the quality of their drives, rejecting any drive with a score below **6.2**. The analysis explores the distribution of production data, identifies anomalies, and investigates the root cause of higher-than-expected shipment rejections.

## Overview
DataStor produces hard drives and uses a **PDQ test score** to evaluate the quality of each drive. Drives with a PDQ score below **6.2** are rejected. The analysis begins by examining the distribution of:
- **Hours worked** by production employees
- **Number of drives produced**
- **Average PDQ scores**

The initial analysis suggests that the data distribution appears normal, and no major issues are evident. However, further investigation reveals a discrepancy between the expected and actual rejection rates, indicating potential quality control problems.

## Key Metrics
- **PDQ Score Threshold**: 6.2 (drives below this score are rejected)
- **Expected Defect
